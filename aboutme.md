## About me

My name is Davide Cittaro, PhD. Through the last >10 years I've been working on several (and assorted) projects involving computational analysis of biological data, basically everything with a _-omics_ suffix (except for metabolomics... Next in line?).

I'm fascinated by the possibilities of merging different branches of (molecular) biology given by computational tools, probably due to my experience with many scientific groups studying unrelated topics. 

I work at the [Center for Omics Sciences](https://research.hsr.it/en/centers/omics-sciences.html), within the [San Raffaele Hospital](http://www.hsr.it) in [Milan](http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/tur/en). I used to be head of bioinformatics there, I left that position to dive in the big sea of research.

This site is intended to be a window on what I'm doing, I hope you may enjoy it.
